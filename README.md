# TipShare
Tipshare is a tip calculator android app. This app was created to make users'lives easier when it comes to calculating tips.
Most of the time, customers have to do the math for the tip amoun and write down the accurate total. This is an affordable and
accesible app.


# What is a Tip?
A tip or gratuity is a sum of money given by clients or customers after the service from the workers
has been performed. Some of the most popular places where tips are given are restaurants, bars, hair
stylists, and taxi drivers. Tips can also vary depending on the country and location. The problem that I
am trying to solve is that most of the time customers that visit these places donâ€™t have an accessible
tool to help them calculate the tip that they are supposed to give.
